# Bootstrap Blog - Static Page - AWS S3 Bucket

This repository was originally a practice I did when I learned Bootstrap. Today I took an [AWS course on how to use S3 Bucket to host a static page](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-quest/). 
My next step will be to host this old project as a static webpage using a AWS S3 Bucket 
(My objective is to use AWS services as I move forward learning)
